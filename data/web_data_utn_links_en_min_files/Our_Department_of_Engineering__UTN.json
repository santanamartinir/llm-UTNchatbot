Prior to this assignment, Wolfram Burgard was Professor of Autonomous Intelligent Systems at the University of Freiburg. In 1991, he completed his dissertation at the Institute of Computer Science at the University Bonn. His focus is on the combination of robotics and artificial intelligence as well as the development of innovative approaches for mobile robots.",
        "section_6": "Professor Burgard has published over 350 papers and articles at conferences and in journals on robotics and artificial intelligence. In 2005, he co-authored two books. The first, titled “Principles of Robot Motion – Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations,” deals with sensor-based planning, stochastic planning, localization, mapping, and motion planning, while the second, titled “Probabilistic Robotics,” covers robot perception and control in the face of uncertainty. He has earned numerous prizes and awards, among them ten Best Paper Awards and two Classic Paper Awards. In 2009, he was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz-Prize and in 2010 the Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. In 2021, he received the Technical Field Award of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.",
        "section_7": "Wolfram Burgard is a member of the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and an honorary member of the European Coordination Committee for Artificial Intelligence, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. In 2008 he became a Fellow of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) and in 2009 a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Prof. Burgard also coordinated the Cluster of Excellence BrainLinks-BrainTools from 2012 to 2019, which is funded by the German Research Foundation.
