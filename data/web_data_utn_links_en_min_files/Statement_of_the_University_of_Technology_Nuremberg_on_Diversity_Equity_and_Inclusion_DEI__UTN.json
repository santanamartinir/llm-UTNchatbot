    "title": "Statement of the University of Technology Nuremberg on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) | UTN",
    "text_sections": {
        "section_1": "Statement of the University of Technology Nuremberg on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)",
        "section_2": "The University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN) is unequivocally committed to respecting human dignity and the core values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). We believe that a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community not only sets the foundation for academic excellence, but is also a reflection of our responsibility as an educational institution. Together, we strive to foster a culture at UTN beneficial to, and experienced and co-created by, all members of our university community, so that they can develop and thrive – A Culture of Belonging, Wellbeing and Compassion.",
        "section_3": "As a university, we stand by freedom of opinion and discourse and regard it as our mission to provide forums for the free expression of opinion as well as spaces for reflection for empathetic dialog and respectful exchange of perspectives and mutual learning – insofar as such expressions and such discourse are compatible with the values and laws of our democracy. We regard supporting personal development and the honing of democratic skills such as critical thinking and social responsibility a fundamental aspect of our mission. At the UTN, we educate responsible people who apply their knowledge to develop solutions for the social challenges of the future.",
        "section_4": "Diversity as Enrichment",
        "section_5": "Our university regards diversity as an opportunity and enrichment. Different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are not only a source of innovation, but also of mutual inspiration. We strive to create an environment in which every single person is respected and valued – regardless of gender or gender identity, race or ethnic background, nationality, religion or ideology, physical and mental abilities, age, sexual orientation or social background.",
        "section_6": "Equity – Justice and Equal Opportunities",
        "section_7": "Equity and equal opportunities are non-negotiable principles for us. We are actively committed to breaking down structural and institutional barriers to ensure equal access to education, research, and professional opportunities. This requires not only continuous reflection on our processes, but also the courage to implement necessary changes and, where necessary, to constructively challenge existing laws and regulations with decision-makers.",
        "section_8": "Inclusion – Conscious Inclusion for Belonging and a Sense of Community",
        "section_9": "For us, inclusion means creating an environment where everyone can feel a sense of belonging – a space where voices are heard, contributions are valued and needs are taken seriously. Promoting wellbeing and compassion is at the core of fostering a culture of belonging and sense of community. A culture of compassion encourages people to look out for each other, take on leadership roles with empathy, and stand up for the needs of others in solidarity.",
        "section_10": "Clear stance against discrimination and misanthropy",
        "section_11": "The University of Technology Nuremberg takes a firm stance against all forms of discrimination and misanthropy – including sexism, racism and anti-Semitism, intimidation, bullying, abuse of power, harassment, and sexualized violence. This is a position we take and stand by since the inception of the UTN. For example, we implemented and developed preventive programs already in the foundation phase of the university. The planning for further development of clear reporting and intervention structures are in progress. These activities and measures ensure that our university is, and will be, a safe place for everyone, where people feel free and safe to turn to us in confidence when subject or witness to  discrimination or misanthropy.",
        "section_12": "Responsibility and commitment",
        "section_13": "Our responsibility does not end at the gates of the university. We seek to be a role model in society in order to reduce prejudice and promote a climate of openness and acceptance. We do not, and cannot, work in isolation to achieve sustainable progress in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Rather, we strive to work with local, national, and international partners to achieve change.",
        "section_14": "We are committed to remaining true to these values in our actions, decisions, and strategies. In doing so, we recognize that the path to a truly inclusive community requires continuous learning and community engagement. We invite all members of the University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN) to play an active role in contributing to and shaping this journey.",
        "section_15": "Together, we can create a university culture characterized by diversity, equity, and belonging – promoting individual growth and development and making a substantial contribution to a just society.",
