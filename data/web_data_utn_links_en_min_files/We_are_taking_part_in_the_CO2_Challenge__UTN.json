        "section_2": "From a meat-free diet and second-hand clothes to a car-free commute: UTN is taking part in the CO2 Challenge of the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region for two weeks. Every day, employees will take on a small challenge to save CO2 and post the results on the UTN Instagram channel.",
        "section_3": "The two-week participatory campaign is aimed at everyone who wants to integrate climate protection and sustainability into their everyday lives in a fun way. The school challenge, which was launched last year, will take place again this year. From Wednesday, February 14, to Tuesday, February 27, the CO2 Challenge homepage and the social media channels of the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region will feature daily inspiring tasks to integrate climate protection into everyday life in a playful way. Climate sins lurk not only in the refrigerator, boiler room or shower, but also in waste, leisure activities and shopping baskets.",
        "section_4": "As an institution, there is of course no prize money for us. But you can participate in the competition: Find the checklist and all other information on the campaign website (https://co2challenge.net/) !",
