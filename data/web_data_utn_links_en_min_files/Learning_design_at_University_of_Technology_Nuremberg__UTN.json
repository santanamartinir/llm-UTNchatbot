Examples of this are assignments, project-based learning, in-class computerized tests, paper-based assignments, group work, oral or written assessments.",
        "section_5": "This variety of assessment forms ensures that learning achievements (intended skills or competencies) can be assessed reliably in a world in which we all can and should use GenAI tools to support our work and learning.

        "section_8": "For example, in a module you may listen to short online presentations and take a quiz about that presentation in preparation for a group-based, interactive, and in-person learning activity, or you work on a project. And it means that you will be expected and encouraged to ! These reflections will be supported by individual feedback and a diverse range of assessment methods.

        "section_15": "You may be wondering what the assessment of your skills will look like. In UTN modules, your skill development will be assessed in stages, using several smaller assignments in a variety of modes for assessing and grading, e.g., conversations, expert discussion, group work, written project reports, oral exams, or others, spread throughout the semester.",
        "section_16": "Based on learning-oriented assignments",
        "section_17": "During the in-person meetings and asynchronous online phases you are given various learning-oriented assignments on which you can directly apply your acquired knowledge, actively reflect on your actions and adapt them with the help of feedback from our professors or teachers. You will receive points for the learning-oriented assignments, which will be accumulated over the entire semester and will contribute to your final grade.",
        "section_18": "Based on a module final assignment (exam)",
        "section_19": "The assessment of each course consists of an exam. This is made up of several assignments and a final assignment, which counts towards 40% to 60% of the final grade. Depending on the course or module, this may be an oral exam (that is built upon the assignments before), or a selected learning-oriented assignment. Completing this assignment is required to determine your final grade.",
        "section_20": "You can read about all learning-oriented assignments in the General Study and Exams Regulations (ASPO) at any time. Please note, that the Regulation document is currently available in German only, as it is the authoritative legal document.
