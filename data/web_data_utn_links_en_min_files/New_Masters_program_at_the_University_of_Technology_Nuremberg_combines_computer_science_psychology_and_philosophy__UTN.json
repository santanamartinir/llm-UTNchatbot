        "section_1": "New Master’s program at the University of Technology Nuremberg combines computer science, psychology and philosophy",
        "section_2": "",
        "section_3": "The interplay between the three disciplines of computer science, psychology and philosophy gives students on the new Master’s program in Human and Artificial Intelligence a unique perspective on the development and use of artificial intelligence. While computer science creates an understanding of the technical foundations, psychology sharpens students’ focus on how people interact with AI systems, for example under what conditions acceptance and trust arise. In the course units on philosophy, cognitive and learning concepts are analyzed, ethical and social implications are questioned and guidelines for the responsible use of AI are provided.",
        "section_4": "In addition to its interdisciplinary focus, the degree program combines theory and practice, for example in the ‘Learning in Transformation’ project. Students work in project teams over two semesters to apply scientific approaches to current problems in industry, society or politics. In this way, they not only deepen their specialized knowledge, but also develop practical solutions to complex challenges. Active participation is emphasized in all courses: Instead of learning by heart, students work on learning-oriented tasks during the semester and receive regular personal feedback on their progress from lecturers.",
        "section_5": "Prof. Gyburg Uhlmann, founding chair of the Department of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, who is responsible for the new Master’s degree program, emphasizes: “Artificial intelligence is increasingly shaping the way we live together. In order to shape it in the interests of people, we need a dialogue between computer science, psychology and philosophy that combines technological possibilities with ethical reflection and a sense of social responsibility. This degree program trains sought-after experts who, with their interdisciplinary profile, have the best chances on the job market.”",
        "section_6": "Students with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, psychology, philosophy or related disciplines can now apply for the Master’s program. The program takes place full-time and on-campus in Nuremberg and lasts four semesters.",

        "section_11": "",
        "section_12": "The University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN), founded in 2021, is the first newly established public university in Bavaria since 1978. The UTN is a living laboratory building a university for the age of AI and the rapidly advancing changes in technology, business and society. The UTN strives to become a strong regional force in research, teaching and transfer and an internationally leading university of the 21st century with regional roots and a global outlook.",
        "section_13": "The 37-hectare, sustainable UTN campus will form the center of the new Lichtenreuth district in Nuremberg, close to the historic city center. Around 6,000 students, 200 professors and at least 2,000 employees will study and work there. Study programs will integrate aspects of technology, liberal arts, social sciences and natural sciences to ideally prepare students for the interdisciplinary requirements of the new world of work.",
