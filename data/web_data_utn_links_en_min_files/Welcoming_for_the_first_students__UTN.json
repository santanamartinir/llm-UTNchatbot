        "section_1": "University of Technology Nuremberg welcomes first Students",
        "section_2": "",
        "section_3": "NUREMBERG. “The moment has arrived – our newest shining star in the academic cosmos is about to take its first radiant steps. We extend a heartfelt welcome to all students at University of Technology Nuremberg! The beginning of the academic program marks a particularly significant moment as the “first freshmen” are now infusing genuine university life into our campus. The degree program is interdisciplinary in design and attracts international talent to Bavaria and perfectly combines theory and practice. This clearly shows where we want to go with UTN: to the future!”, emphasizes Markus Blume, Minister of State for Science and the Arts.",
        "section_4": "In under three years since its establishment, UTN is set to commence teaching with the Master’s degree program in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics during the winter semester 2023/2024. Applications were accepted until mid June. Almost 90 percent of the applications came from abroad. Founding President, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Hans Jürgen Prömel emphasizes: “We are excited to embrace numerous gifted students from all around the globe and are eager to anticipate the intercultural viewpoints they will introduce to Nuremberg as a center of innovation.”",
        "section_5": "Lord Mayor Marcus König is enthusiastic: “The University of Technology Nuremberg is a major future project for the city and the region.  Personally, it is incredibly touching for me to have the privilege of extending a warm welcome to the first group of students at UTN. To a university that enriches the academic landscape with a consistent interdisciplinary approach, an innovative range of subjects, new teaching methods, and a forward-thinking organizational structure. The start of the degree program is a significant milestone in the development of UTN for Nuremberg.”",
        "section_6": "High percentage of international applications",
        "section_7": "A total of around 100 applications were received from 31 countries. According to Prof. Dr. Isa Jahnke, Founding Vice President for Academic and International Affairs, this is a good result: “Utilizing our existing staff resources, we effectively managed the volume of applications. Maintaining a favorable support-to-student ratio is one of our distinctive strengths: We will have six professors available for the students. And in the application process, we also rely on an individualized support ratio: We conducted interviews with numerous candidates to present ourselves and our vision, ensuring that the applicants align well with our goals.” However, she identified room for improvement in one aspect: “Unfortunately, we did not have many female applicants and therefore we want to target this group more in the future. We are committed to promoting women in engineering and will encourage them to apply.”",
        "section_8": "Future AI Experts",
        "section_9": "The inaugural degree program at UTN will provide a wide array of courses and events focusing on contemporary and pertinent subjects in robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and data science. The students are trained to become experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, capable of developing and providing innovative and forward-thinking solutions for the industry and research – for example in image processing, machine learning and data analysis. Furthermore, the study curriculum is enriched by incorporating subjects from the humanities and social sciences, along with an exploration of ethical, philosophical, and business considerations. Through this approach, students acquire the ability to employ technology in a responsible manner and can critically reflect the limitations of existing technological constraints.",
        "section_10": "A University without lecture halls and traditional exams",
        "section_11": "Apart from its interdisciplinary focus, the program establishes a connection between theoretical knowledge and practical application. In all the modules provided, the emphasis lies on activating teaching and learning methods in small group settings, offering individual feedback and competence-based assessments, rather than conventional frontal instruction and traditional exams. The Master’s program has four semesters and includes 120 ECTS. This program is a full-time, digitally enhanced, in-person study experience, with all courses conducted in the English language. For the time being, the courses will be held in the interim building on Ulmenstrasse. Starting 2024 some courses will also be offered in Cube One, the first building on the campus site currently under construction.",

        "section_19": "The University of Technology Nuremberg was founded on January 1, 2021 and has been the first new foundation of a state-run university in Bavaria since 1978.  With its consistently interdisciplinary approach, an innovative spectrum of subjects, new teaching methods and a future-oriented organizational structure, a model university will be created when it comes to teaching and research. The university is to have an international, interdisciplinary and digital approach. Upon completion, up to 6,000 students will be able to study on a campus embedded in the surrounding quarters.",
