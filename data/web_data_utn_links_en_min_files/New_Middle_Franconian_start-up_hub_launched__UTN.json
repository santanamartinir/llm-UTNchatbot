        "section_3": "To further solidify Bavaria’s position as a start-up state, the “Hightech Transfer Bayern” initiative is dedicated to support young entrepreneurs in setting up their own business ventures. Start-up hubs have been established in the university regions of Swabia, Upper Franconia, Lower Franconia, Eastern Bavaria and Middle Franconia, enabling the practical realization of the entrepreneurial spirit. These regional hubs aim to advance and broaden start-up education through academic programs, financial support for start-ups, and hands-on assistance.",
        "section_4": "In this context, UTN collaborates with FAU, Ohm and Ansbach University of Applied Sciences to represent the Middle Franconian university region:  The Entrepreneurial Innovation Hub offers a comprehensive three-phase educational program for students, where they collaborate across different universities to conceive and implement innovative projects, and make necessary adjustments based on the outcome. The final phase of the start-up process places special emphasis on the transition of newly developed products and services from these projects to the industrial sector. The program is complemented by optional courses, opportunities for international study at partner institutions, and a start-up track to prepare students for launching their own business.",
        "section_5": "“At UTN, we focus on networking – not only with our interdisciplinary approach in research and teaching, but also through the cooperation of science and industry. We aim to develop solutions for industry and society. With the Entrepreneurial Innovation Hub, we can intensify our work in this direction. As a newly founded university we are looking forward to collaborating with the other partners and building a strong network the entire metropolitan region can benefit from”, emphasizes Prof. Dr. Alexander Martin, Founding Vice President for Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.",
        "section_6": "Over a period of five years, the hightech initiative will fund the Entrepreneurial Innovation Hub with approx. 480,000 Euros and two permanent positions. In the event of a positive final evaluation, the Middle Franconian hub can become a permanent institution. Starting spring of 2024, students can apply to join the program. The first pilot run will take place in the winter semester 2024/25 and the summer semester 2025.",
