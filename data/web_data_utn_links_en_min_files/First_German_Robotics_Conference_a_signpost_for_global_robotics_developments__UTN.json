        "section_2": "",
        "section_3": "With over 1,200 scientific publications in the last five years, more than 70 major projects supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and nine German universities among the top 100 in the global CS ranking for robotics, the location is ideal. A trend study by the consulting firm Capgemini shows that AI-based robotics and generative AI are among the top five technology trends worldwide in 2025. AI-based robotics is also becoming increasingly important for industry: almost half of companies surveyed worldwide (48%) are currently developing application scenarios and 89% of investors are convinced that AI-based robotics will be one of the top three technology topics in 2025.",
        "section_4": "",
        "section_5": "At the GRC, leading researchers, mainly from Germany, including RIG coordinator Prof. Angela Schoellig from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), RIG spokesperson Prof. Tamim Asfour from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Prof. Wolfram Burgard as local host, and RIG partner University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN) will jointly provide insights into current research on AI-based robotics in Germany for the first time:",

        "section_7": "Further information on the conference can be found here (https://www.robotics-institute-germany.de/conference/) .",
        "section_8": "",
        "section_9": "The Robotics Institute Germany is an initiative that the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) has been funding with 20 million euros over four years since 2024. The RIG comprises 14 German universities and research institutions. There are also 19 associated partners. The aim is to connect leading robotics sites in Germany, increase international visibility, attract talent, and accelerate progress in AI-powered robotics.",
        "section_10": "",
        "section_11": "The University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN), founded in 2021, is the first newly established public university in Bavaria since 1978. The UTN is a living laboratory building a university for the age of AI and the rapidly advancing changes in technology, business and society. The UTN strives to become a strong regional force in research, teaching and transfer and an internationally leading university of the 21st century with regional roots and a global outlook.",
        "section_12": "The 37-hectare, sustainable UTN campus will form the center of the new Lichtenreuth district in Nuremberg, close to the historic city center. Around 6,000 students, 200 professors and at least 2,000 employees will study and work there. Study programs will integrate aspects of technology, liberal arts, social sciences and natural sciences to ideally prepare students for the interdisciplinary requirements of the new world of work.",
