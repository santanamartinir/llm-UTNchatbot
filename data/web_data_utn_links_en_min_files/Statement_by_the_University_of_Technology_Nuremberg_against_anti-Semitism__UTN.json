    "title": "Statement by the University of Technology Nuremberg against anti-Semitism | UTN",
    "text_sections": {
        "section_1": "Statement by the University of Technology Nuremberg against anti-Semitism",
        "section_2": "The UTN notes with concern that anti-Semitism, discrimination and racism are spreading and radicalizing worldwide and also in Germany. This does not stop at universities; indeed, it is often the universities in particular where anti-Semitic propaganda, calls for violence against Jews, exclusion and physical attacks take place or where various forms of anti-Semitism find their supposed justification in their discourses.",
        "section_3": "The UTN expresses with this statement that we condemn antisemitism, discrimination, and racism in all its forms, that they have no place here, and that we actively oppose them. We expressly endorse the “Resolution for respect at Bavarian universities and against discrimination, racism and anti-Semitism” in all its parts.",
        "section_4": "We are convinced that universities have a special societal responsibility to be a space for the free exchange of rational arguments, opinions, and perspectives, while also clearly addressing where the limits of freedom of expression are crossed, rational dialogue is abandoned, and hate, agitation, incitement to violence, and a willingness to commit violence occur. Right-wing extremist, nationalist, radical left-wing and Muslim anti-Semitism must be condemned, prevented and prosecuted in the same way as anti-Israeli anti-Semitism.",
        "section_5": "Universities are not a lawless space, but as places of knowledge formation and reflection, they guarantee that no discourse outside the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany will be tolerated in them.",
        "section_6": "As a newly founded campus university in the immediate vicinity of the former Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg, the UTN recognizes its special responsibility in the fight against all forms of anti-Semitism and wants to actively assume this responsibility. We are developing the campus and our university as a cornerstone in aligning the city of Nuremberg with its identity as a City of Human Rights.",
        "section_7": "The City of Nuremberg is committed to diversity and democratic cohesion and works together with the Bavarian state government and its municipal institutions to commemorate National Socialism and historical forms of anti-Semitism, to prevent new forms of anti-Semitism, to strengthen Jewish life in the region and to assume its responsibility in the fight against anti-Semitic hatred in particular.",
        "section_8": "As a university, we are committed to research, teaching, transfer and communication to educate people about all forms of anti-Semitism, including hidden forms, and also to strengthen rational exchange in the negotiation of opinions as a whole, which can contribute to transforming emotionally escalating debates into an argumentative and appreciative dialog.",
        "section_9": "Universities should be a safe place where all participants in academic discourse are respected and enjoy engaging in academic and social dialog with the greatest possible freedom of thought. The UTN strives to achieve this with determination and strategic intent in all aspects of its development work.",
        "section_10": "Therefore, in accordance with and on the basis of the Bavarian Plan of Action against Anti-Semitism at Universities (https://www.bayern.de/bollwerk-gegen-antisemitismus-an-hochschulen-bayerischer-aktionsplan-und-beauftragte-an-allen-hochschulen-in-bayern/) , the UTN would like to contribute to making Bavarian universities a safe space for Jews and thus for all their members almost 80 years after the end of the Holocaust.",
        "section_11": "With our measures and objectives in 5 dimensions, we are guided by the Bavarian Plan of Action and the resolution “Solidarity with Israel – strengthening Jewish life in Bavaria” passed by the Bavarian State Parliament on October 8, 2024 (https://www.bayern.landtag.de/www/ElanTextAblage_WP19/Drucksachen/Folgedrucksachen/0000002500/0000002805.pdf) .",
        "section_12": "5 Dimensions:",
        "section_13": "We are developing an emergency plan as to which actors will become active in the event of an attack on Jewish members of the university or in the event of anti-Semitic statements or images within the university or with reference to the UTN (in both analog and digital space) and what measures will be taken. The UTN intends to use all legal leeway to react with maximum clarity and to take a clear stance against anti-Semitism.",
        "section_14": "",
        "section_15": "Anti-Semitic incitement and hatred are not always easy to recognize at first glance. We therefore offer our members information and compact training courses to raise awareness of the problem and its extent. In the future, such training, together with other security training and awareness-raising, will become mandatory for all UTN employees. As a natively digital technical university with a focus on artificial intelligence, we are committed to ensuring that no anti-Semitic attitudes and statements are tolerated in the digital space, social networks or chat groups related to the UTN. In addition to raising awareness, it should also be clearly communicated when action or silence is punishable.",
        "section_16": "The historical and communicative background, manifestations and consequences of anti-Semitism have not yet been sufficiently researched. This applies to the real world, but even more so to the digital space and the challenges and completely new opportunities that arise with the development of artificial intelligence in the fight against extremism, hate speech and group-based hatred. The UTN would like to make a contribution here by setting up a research area and integrating elements of research and clarification of anti-Semitism in the interaction between analog and digital space into teaching.",
        "section_17": "The UTN advocates the strengthening of rational argument over expressions of subjective feeling in the conviction that this contributes to the strengthening of our free democratic basic order and the freedom of research and teaching, but also freedom of opinion, and in the fight against all forms of extremism and discrimination.",
        "section_18": "The UTN actively recruits Israeli students and establishes student and lecturer exchanges with universities in Israel.",
        "section_19": "Prof. Dr. Gyburg Uhlmann (https://www.utn.de/person/prof-dr-gyburg-uhlmann/) Anti-Semitism Commissioner at the University of Technology Nuremberg Department Liberal Arts and Sciences  +49 911 92741604 (tel:+49-911-92741604) department-lias-chair@utn.de (mailto:department-lias-chair@utn.de)",
