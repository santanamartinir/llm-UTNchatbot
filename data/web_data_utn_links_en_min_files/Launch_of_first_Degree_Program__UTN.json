        "section_3": "NÜRNBERG. Prof Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Hans Jürgen Prömel, Founding President, explains: “We will start teaching, even before our third birthday. This is a great achievement for a university with a staff of 50 people. We are happy that we can shape UTN specifically with regard to teaching with the start of our Master degree program and thus strengthen Nuremberg as a business and science location.” In accordance with the international orientation of the university the Master degree program will be held in English. A welcome center is currently being established to facilitate the new beginning in Nuremberg for students from abroad.",
        "section_4": "",
        "section_5": "Besides the interdisciplinary focus, the degree program links theory with practice, f. e. with the project Learning in Transformation. During two semesters, the students will work in project teams and use scientific approaches to solve real-world problems in industry, society or politics. All offered modules focus on digitally supported teaching formats, activating teaching methods in small groups and competency-based assessments. “UTN will be a university without auditoriums, lectures and written exams. We adjust our degree programs to our students and will react to each and every one with activating teaching and learning strategies as well as individual feedback rounds.  All contents and methods are aligned to fit clearly defined learning objectives” according to Founding Vice President for Academic and International Affairs.",
        "section_6": "",
        "section_7": "Application is possible until May 31, 2023. Requirements are a Bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field as well as an English language proficiency certificate. The size of the program is determined by the aptitude assessment process that applicants will undergo. Before the teaching and learning at the newly founded university will kick off on October 16, the university invites the students to a welcome week. For now, the courses will be held at the interim location in Ulmenstraße.  Starting 2024, some courses will also be offered at Cube One, the first building on the campus area currently under construction. At the same time, additional degree programs are being prepared: For 2025 and 2026, two additional Master degree programs each are scheduled. For 2028 it is planned to welcome Bachelor students as well at the UTN.",
