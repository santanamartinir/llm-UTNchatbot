The project aims to develop basic models for special databases that are used in many industrial applications.",
        "section_4": "The funding line actively promotes interdisciplinary research projects within the UTN. The aim is to provide systematic incentives for networking research areas and researchers from different disciplines and, in a further step, to support the initiation of collaborative projects.",
        "section_5": "AgileTeams@UTN generally funds research projects for a period of three years with two doctoral positions and the option of an additional one-year extension. The procedure consists of a short proposal and a project pitch in front of a panel of experts with a balanced range of expertise, which is chaired by the Vice President for Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The new funding line supports the establishment of fields of activity and makes a significant contribution to building UTN’s profile.",
