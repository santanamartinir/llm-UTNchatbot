        "section_3": "NUREMBERG. As a symbol for the planned tramway line to the new University of Technology Nuremberg, Tim Dahlmann-Resing, Member of the Executive Board at VAG for Technology and Marketing, presented Dr. Markus Zanner, Kanzler of the University, with a tramway model today. “Our tramway model symbolizes the strong connection between ourselves, the university and the city of Nuremberg. It is a commitment to more public transport, less car traffic and a climate-neutral, viable, just and sustainable mobility concept. We are very happy to be able to integrate the new university and living quarters into our well-developed public transport network from the start”, comments Tim Dahlmann-Resing. Dr. Markus Zanner adds: “On the former southern railway station, a car-free campus will be built with a special focus on the conservation of important green areas and the use of ecological building materials. A good connection to the public transport network not only shows the sustainable planning concept – it is also an integral part of a new urban university campus.”",

        "section_5": "The new tramway line will be 2.5 km long and will cross Frankenstraße from the direction Allersberger Straße, passing between the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees and the Z-Bau towards the south via Ingolstädter Straße into the area of the former southern railway station. A turning loop will be built where the Park&Ride parking lot is situated today to provide direct access to the underground station there. The tramway line will be routed on a separate green track. Parallel to the tramway line, a foodpath and a bicycle lane will be built. Five new and barrier-free tramway stations are scheduled.",
