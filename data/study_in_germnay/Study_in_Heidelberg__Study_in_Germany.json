The city is home to the oldest university in Germany and several other higher education institutions and research facilities.

        "section_18": "While Heidelberg is home to several higher education institutions and research institutes, it is most famous for Heidelberg University, the oldest university in Germany, founded in 1386. Today, the university’s medical faculty, in particular, has a good reputation. There are also numerous companies in and around Heidelberg that have specialised in medicine and health. The German cancer research centre  (https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) is also headquartered in Heidelberg. Because the university has been in existence for so long, it has no central campus but is spread all over the town. The natural sciences even have their own district, Neuenheimer Feld.",
        "section_19": "In Heidelberg, you can walk or cycle everywhere. Situated at the foot of Königsstuhl, the town is very hilly. So wherever you’re heading, you either have to go uphill, or if you’re lucky, downhill. But it’s these hills that make Heidelberg and the surrounding area so attractive. Strolling along the Philosophenweg in the evening and enjoying the view of the town and the castle is a unique experience! And if you don’t fancy walking, there are plenty of buses and trams that will take you to virtually every corner of town. Even up the steep streets…",
        "section_20": "Heidelberg has many English-speaking districts because for many years the American Allied Forces were based here. You can see where they used to live from the names of the districts, for example, the Patrick Henry Village.",
        "section_21": "If you’re looking for evening entertainment, you’ll soon realise that Heidelberg is a small town. You won’t have to worry about catching the last train home because you can always walk or cycle. There are lots of bars and pubs in Heidelberg, the majority are located on Untere Street. The people of Heidelberg simply call it “Die Untere“. This is a good place for meeting friends and fellow students at the weekend. You’ll find all kinds of bars and pubs here.",
