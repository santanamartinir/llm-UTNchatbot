        "section_20": "The people of Mainz are enthusiastic party-goers. And partying becomes particularly riotous during Fastnacht, as the people of Mainz call their carnival. This is when they dress up in fancy costumes. Celebrations culminate in the Rose Monday procession at the end of February or beginning of March. Decorated carnival floats, marching bands and dance troupes parade through the town, throwing sweets into the crowds of revellers. Fastnacht even has a monument: the „Fastnachtsbrunnen“, or carnival fountain, on Schillerplatz.",
        "section_21": "The people of Mainz celebrate lots of festivals. And one thing that should never be missing from such a festival is wine. The people of Mainz love their wine. There are two wine festivals that take place in the Stadtpark. There, you can sample different wines at the numerous stands. The market is most beautiful at night when everything is romantically illuminated.",
        "section_22": "Johannisnacht is also a well-known and popular festival. This four-day public event in June features musical and cabaret performances but also a book and art market. There’s a funfair on the banks of the Rhine with lots of different amusements and funfair rides such as the Big Wheel, which offers you a fantastic view of the city. The festival ends with a big firework display over the Rhine.",
        "section_23": "You can go on an extensive shopping tour in the area around the theatre. Get off at the „Höfchen“ bus stop and you’ll find yourself in the middle of the pedestrian area. Marktplatz am Dom is just a few metres away. Here you’ll find department stores, boutiques and street cafés with a view of the cathedral. The Gutenberg shop and ZDF shop are also located here.",
        "section_24": "When the weather’s good, Stadtpark and Volkspark are great places to go. The two parks run into each other, and this is where students meet for picnics. There are also a minigolf course, café and designated barbecue spots. From the Stadtpark, you have a good view of the Rhine, which is not far away. You can jog or cycle along the Rheinpromenade or simply relax on the banks of the river. One Rhine highlight is a beach bar on Adenauer-Ufer. On hot summer days, you can hang out in deckchairs and hammocks or play beach volleyball with friends.",
        "section_25": "Lots of student parties take place in Mainz on Wednesdays and Thursdays and there’s plenty going in town in the evenings. For example, Mainz has several Irish pubs that organise karaoke evenings. KUZ is also a good place for different kinds of entertainment. The culture centre organises parties, readings and concerts.",
