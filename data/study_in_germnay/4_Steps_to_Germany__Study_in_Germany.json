        "section_17": "Would you like to live in Germany for a period of time? You should consider what your goals are for your stay and whether you meet all the requirements. Your daily life should also run as smoothly as possible. To those ends, there are four steps that will get you to Germany.",
        "section_18": "Determine the type of Stay",
        "section_19": "Are you planning to come to Germany before, during or after your studies? You can choose between different options: for example, a language course, an exchange semester at a German higher education institution, or an internship at an exciting company. Another alternative is to make Germany your home for several years by deciding on a complete degree course or a PhD.",
        "section_20": "– German higher education institutions run a variety of short-term courses in the summer and winter academic breaks. Specialist and language classes can deepen your knowledge, provide opportunities to meet others and are a lot of fun.",
        "section_21": "– An exchange semester will allow you to get to know a new culture and improve your language abilities while continuing your studies.",
        "section_22": "– Internships give you first experiences in the working world. There are many companies in Germany that offer internship opportunities.",
        "section_23": "– It’s worth doing some research. German higher education institutions offer a wide range of courses ending in internationally renowned degrees.",
        "section_24": "– Germany is a popular host country for doctoral candidates from all over the world. The research landscape is excellent.",
        "section_25": "Check the requirements",
        "section_26": "To study at a German institute of higher education, you will need a Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (HZB – a certificate of aptitude for higher education), in other words a secondary-school degree that qualifies you to study in Germany. If your secondary-school degree isn’t recognized in Germany, you will usually need to attend a preparatory college (Studienkolleg).",
        "section_27": "The Formalities",
        "section_28": "Do you need a visa? That depends on which country you come from and how long you want to stay in Germany.",
        "section_29": "All students, however, need two documents. One is a proof of financial ressources (Finanzierungsnachweis) that shows you have enough money to support yourself during your studies. The minimum is currently 10,332 euros annually. You will also need to prove that you have health insurance while studying in Germany.",
        "section_30": "Choose your study options",
        "section_31": "Germany’s university towns are very diverse: from places with historic centres full of cultural treasures and cosy bars to big cities famous around the world. But not every higher education institution will necessarily offer the course you’re interested in. So take a close, preferably first-hand, look at the various options.",
        "section_32": "Your Degree",
        "section_33": "The question of what degree you’ll be working toward in Germany is another major decision-making factor. Depending on the courses, German institutions of higher education offer bachelor’s, master’s degrees and “State Examination” (Staatsexamen) – in rare cases also “Magister Artium” or “Magistra Artium” and “Diplom”. There are also lots of opportunities for young scholars to get their doctorates.",
        "section_34": "Start to prepare",
        "section_35": "The best way to reach a destination is to take one small step at a time, and that includes staying in Germany. You will have several things to do between the point at which you decide to go to Germany and when you arrive there. Tip: start early, make sure you’re aware of what’s required, keep an eye on important deadlines and focus on the following topics.",
