        "section_20": "One example of combined programmes is the field of Sustainability Studies. It brings together various disciplines to work towards one common goal: creating a livable and environmentally friendly future. Sustainability is more than just environmental protection—it requires a deep understanding of ecology, economics, and society. In this program, you’ll combine natural sciences like biology and geography with humanities and social sciences, such as ethics, environmental policy, and economics. This prepares you to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges.",
