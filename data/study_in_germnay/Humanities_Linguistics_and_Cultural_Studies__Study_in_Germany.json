        "section_12": "Studying the humanities requires a lot of self-discipline since German institutes of higher education don’t monitor and structure students’ courses nearly as much as they do in other countries. Good German is one of the major prerequisites, and it’s important that you set priorities and gain practical experience while you are still enrolled.",

        "section_19": "Job announcements rarely mention humanities qualifications, and most humanities don’t point students clearly toward any particular career. For that reason, it’s important that you set priorities and gain practical experience while you’re still studying. Independent initiative and enthusiasm for what you do are also very important. It’s recommended that your resumé displays a clear sense of direction.",
        "section_20": "Almost all degree programmes contain integrated modules which provide students with key qualifications and practical skills. These include orientation modules, professionally related events, foreign language instruction and business management know-how. Many degree programmes also require students to complete a study semester abroad at a partner university, a field research project or a foreign internship.",
        "section_21": "Considerable Job Flexibility",
        "section_22": "With their trained abilities in the management of knowledge and their intercultural skills, humanities graduates are increasingly sought after in various economic sectors. With its broad spectrum of content and problem-solving orientation, a course in the humanities can offer you considerable job flexibility.",
        "section_23": "The classic sectors for humanities graduates include media and communications, education and publishing. But degree holders also frequently find work in atypical areas and fields like manufacturing, trade, legal and business consulting, banking, health care and IT.",
