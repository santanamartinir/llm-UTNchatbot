Once you’re officially enrolled, you are allowed to attend courses at university, take examinations and obtain an academic degree. Enrolment allows you to gain access to all the facilities at the university. Students are normally required to enrol in person at the Office of Student Affairs („Studentensekretariat“) at the university.",
        "section_20": "After enrolment",
        "section_21": "Along with the student ID card, every newly enrolled student receives an account on the university server, e-mail address and password. You will need this information to take advantage of your university’s intranet services, such as the electronic course prospectus, online registration for courses and exams and online course material provided by your instructors. As soon as you are enrolled, you should register with the institute or department responsible for your subject of study. If you’re majoring in more than one subject, you may have to register at several institutes. You can do this at the administrative office in your institute or department. Sometimes they issue you a separate departmental ID (for which you need a passport photo). With this ID card, you can use the facilities reserved for members of the institute, for example, the specialist library.",
        "section_22": "Student ID Card",
        "section_23": "Every student at university is issued a student ID card. You will need your card to use the library, dining hall, computer rooms, sports facilities, etc. The student ID frequently doubles as a ticket for public transportation in the university town. You can also receive special student discounts with your card, for example, on tickets to cultural events, swimming pools, museums and trade fairs.",
