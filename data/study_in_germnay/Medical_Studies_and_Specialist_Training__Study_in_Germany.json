        "section_20": "A numerus clausus applies nationwide. This key admission restriction is based on your high school grades. At some universities, an additional test for medical courses (TMS, also known as the “medical test”) is required. This is a subject-specific study aptitude test that rates understanding of scientific and medical problems. It is held annually.",
        "section_21": "Compared to other courses, the demands in medicine are particularly high. Medical studies are very study-intensive and include many exams.",
        "section_22": "Medical specialists: Careers beyond caring for the ill",
        "section_23": "Some 10,000 medical degrees are awarded at universities in Germany every year. And finding a job in a hospital or settling down is not difficult outside of the big cities. Family doctors are urgently needed, especially in rural regions. Health care is making great advances, so people in Germany are living longer. This means they also have to be treated more frequently and at greater expense. As a result, job prospects are also excellent for the future. But there are also interesting jobs outside of traditional medical practices and hospitals. Medical expertise is valuable for careers in medical technology, the pharmaceutical industry, and hospital administration. Management consultancies and insurance companies are also options for people completing a medical degree.",
        "section_24": "Alternative: Studies in health sciences",
        "section_25": "The health care system requires more than doctors. The well-being of an entire population is at the centre of the field of public health. Public health examines the interaction between people and their environment, develops strategies for coping with health problems and deals with the economics of health care.",
        "section_26": "In these courses you are prepared for a variety of careers in the health care industry. Well-trained public health scientists are in demand to promote corporate or municipal health as well as in the pharmaceutical industry, international organizations and consumer protection. Public health departments at schools issue both bachelors and masters degrees in health management, health economics and health education. Some of the courses require prior vocational training, often completed while working part time. These programmes are aimed at people who are already working in therapeutical, care giving or social science professions. The course imparts medical, health and social science knowledge, but also subject-related aspects of psychology and economics.",
