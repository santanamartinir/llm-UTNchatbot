        "section_19": "Cycling is affordable and healthy, it is easy on the environment, and is very practical at the same time, especially in the city. The fastest way to get to your destination is often by bike. You can park your bike almost anywhere. You don’t have to buy tickets or refuel. And you don’t get stuck in traffic or have to wait for the bus. Most cities have specially marked paths for cycling and many places where you can lock your bike.",

        "section_22": "Travelling with buses and trains in the city",
        "section_23": "Public transport in Germany is called öffentlicher Personennahverkehr, or just ÖPNV. It includes buses and trains (underground trains, metro trains and trams). Timetables are posted at all stops. Timetables illustrate which lines go where, and when, and how long they take to get to each stop. Most of the time public transport is punctual. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, busses and trains run less often than on weekdays. You can get a route map from train and bus stations, and the local tourism office. Tickets are required for most public transport.",
        "section_24": "Depending on the location and means of transport, you can buy tickets via an app, before boarding at ticket machines, or in the vehicle. Sometime machines only accept cash, so be prepared.",

        "section_27": "Coaches: an alternative to trains",

        "section_30": "Riding taxis",
        "section_31": "Riding in a taxi is relatively expensive in Germany. Prices vary slightly from city to city. You should expect to pay about 1.50 euros to three euros per kilometre. Often there is also a basic price of 2.50 to 3.50 euros for starting the meter. If you can share the fare with others, taking a taxi may be an option, especially if you missed the night bus or the last train.",
        "section_32": "Taxis can be found waiting at the taxi stands in the cities, or you can hail a moving taxi if it has no fare. You can also book them by phone or online, and order them to a specific location. Check the internet for telephone numbers of local taxi dispatchers.",
        "section_33": "Travelling by car",
        "section_34": "You need a valid driving license to drive a car in Germany. Your EU member state driver’s license is generally valid here. Non-EU licenses may be subject to other rules.

        "section_36": "Opportunities for ride sharing",
        "section_37": "Sharing a ride to a common destination is very popular with students. A driver with free seats in their car will seek other riders to share the costs.",
        "section_38": "Rideshares are very inexpensive, but they are also a great way to meet interesting new people. You can find ride-sharing opportunities on the internet. At many universities there is also a “passenger board” where upcoming rides are posted.",
