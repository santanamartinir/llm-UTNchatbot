        "section_12": "A cosmopolitan outlook and international experience will make it much easier for you to begin your career as a graduate of an economics or social science degree. On the other hand, studying law in Germany is particularly useful if you want in-depth knowledge of the German legal system. This makes you attractive for the German job market, and your expertise here increases your chances of working for international law firms in other countries.",

        "section_18": "Economics",
        "section_19": "Training at German institutes of higher education is broadly based in these traditional studies. Business administration deals with the conditions, changes and processes in companies. Economics, in turn, deals with issues covering the entire social spectrum and tries to understand the relevant processes and relationships. The basic studies for both majors are often very similar. You can also choose one of the many English-language courses. But if you wish to work in a German company at some point in the future, it is important that you also learn the German language.",
        "section_20": "There is great demand for economists",
        "section_21": "From the health industry to cultural management, there are few industries today that can do without economic expertise. The professional opportunities for economists are very diverse as a result. You can find openings nearly everywhere, in managerial positions in public companies as well as in the human resources departments of large companies, in controlling, sales, in advisory and consulting, and on the board of directors of corporations and medium-sized companies. Degree programs such as sports economics, transport management, or management in the health and social sector, combine economic know-how with sector-specific classes. They prepare you specifically for a career in the specialty areas.",
        "section_22": "Global players like carmaker BMW or engineering giant Siemens are world-famous. In Germany, however, there are also many medium-sized companies that are global leaders with their markets. Last but not least, small and medium-sized companies are looking for well-trained economists with international experience. The great demand is reflected in colleges and universities. Some ten percent of students in Germany now opt for the subject of international business administration/management. Thatâ€™s twice as many as for traditional economics.",
        "section_23": "Banking and finance courses are also very popular. Here you will learn how global markets, the banking business and fluctuating financial markets work. It is important that you like to deal with mathematical and statistical analysis, because they are an essential part of the course.",
        "section_24": "Social sciences",
        "section_25": "What influences people and the societies they live in? The economy, for one, but also culture and politics. In social science majors such as sociology and political science, you will deal with many different disciplines at once. There are interfaces with psychology and education as well as with economics, ethnology and history.",
