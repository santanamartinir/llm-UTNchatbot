The document you need is called a “Finanzierungsnachweis”, or proof of financial resources.  In most cases, applicants have to prove that they have around 11.208 euros at their disposal for one year.

Only then should you send your documents to the selected financial institute. Please note: Do not send your documents as attached scans by e-mail or by fax; the bank only accepts originals.
