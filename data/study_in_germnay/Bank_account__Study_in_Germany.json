        "section_12": "Having a bank account in Germany is very practical. With a German bank account, you can transfer your semester contribution to the university electronically after enrolment, pay your monthly rent and receive your salary from a part-time job. You can also withdraw money from cash machines free of charge.",

        "section_18": "If you’re planning on staying longer than a couple of weeks in Germany, you should open a current account here. They are usually free of charge for students. The formalities involved are not too complicated. And the advantages certainly outweigh the disadvantages. For example, you can withdraw money free of charge from cash machines in Germany, make payments electronically, and set up “standing orders” for regular payments – like  (/en/plan-your-studies/preparation/accomodation/) ,  (/en/plan-your-studies/requirements/health-insurance/) or telephone bills – which ensures that the money is transferred automatically and on time every month. If you take a  (/en/germany/everyday-life/work/) job in Germany, you will need a current account to receive your pay.",
        "section_19": "There are numerous commercial and savings banks which operate branches in cities throughout Germany. There are also a number of online banks which offer the entire range of services via the Internet – from setting up the account to all necessary transactions.",
        "section_20": "Bank transactions, such as transfers and standing orders, can be done online or at specially marked bank machines in the bank or at the counter.",
        "section_21": "DEBIT CARDS",
        "section_22": "Once you’ve opened a current account, you will be issued a debit card, with which you can withdraw money from cash machines and print out your bank statements yourself. In Germany, debit cards are often referred to as EC-, Giro- or Maestro cards. You can use EC cards to pay at shops and restaurants. The cashier will ask you to either authorise the payment with a PIN (personal identification number) or sign the receipt.",
        "section_23": "All commonly used credit cards, i.e. MasterCard, Visa and American Express, are accepted in Germany. You can also use your credit card to withdraw money from cash machines, but credit card companies usually charge exorbitant fees for this service. If you already have a credit card and wish to use it for an extended period of time in Germany, you should notify your bank or credit card company in advance. Although many Germans have credit cards, they generally prefer paying with their EC card, as it’s accepted practically everywhere in Germany nowadays.",
