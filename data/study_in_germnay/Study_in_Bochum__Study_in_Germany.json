If you keep an open mind, you’ll recognise its charm and learn to appreciate the honesty of its inhabitants. Bochum is situated in the urbanised Ruhr region, a former industrial powerhouse and in 2010 one of Europe’s capitals of culture.",

        "section_18": "Walking through the city, you can still see the traces of Bochum’s industrial past. The last mining buildings are still standing on the city outskirts, closed-down factories which had once produced steel, and the pubs where the former “Kumpel” (coal miners) still meet. Bochum used to be grey and bleak, a city of factories and workers. Its work-weary past is evident in its often plain, functional buildings. You won’t find a quaint historic centre here. Even the architectural style of the Ruhr University, located on a hill at the edge of town, was clearly designed to be functional. The boxy-looking buildings from the 1970s are divided into departments and arranged on campus accordingly.",
        "section_19": "You can gain an impression of times past in Bochum’s most famous museum – the  (https://www.bergbaumuseum.de/en/) . There you can experience how important coal mining was to the city and see the melancholy in the eyes of some of the visitors. You also get a sense of the grandeur of the past in the Jahrhunderthalle, which now serves as a venue for concerts and performances.",
        "section_20": "You can experience even more nature to the south of Bochum at Kemnader Lake. There’s an eight-kilometre path around its periphery where you can go jogging, inline-skating, biking or hiking. You’re not allowed to go swimming there, but you can rent a paddle boat or a canoe and paddle across the lake.",
        "section_21": "When people from Bochum go out, they meet up at the “Bermuda Dreieck“ – several streets at the edge of downtown filled with pubs, bars and clubs. Lots of people sit at tables outside and enjoy the weather in the summertime. It’s also the scene of concerts, parties and events of all kinds, which are especially popular among students.",
        "section_22": "One of the major summer highlights is the “Bochum Total” festival. You can enjoy concerts by well-known and new, up-and-coming bands throughout the city for four days at no charge.",
