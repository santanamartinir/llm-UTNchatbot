        "section_18": "Chemnitz is a working-class city with a very eventful history which is still evident today. Thousands of jobs were lost due to the economic turmoil which resulted from the demise of the GDR. But since then, the city has gotten back onto its feet and is growing again. There are still many vacant flats in town, which is why rental prices are very reasonable. It’s not very hard to find a nice, affordable flat.",
        "section_19": "You can learn more about the city’s industrial history at the  (https://web.saechsisches-industriemuseum.com/en/chemnitz.html) . In addition to steam-powered locomotives and many other exhibits, you can also admire the famous Trabi. This iconic car was originally developed in Chemnitz and dominated the streets of the former GDR.",
        "section_20": "The city centre has been completely redesigned over the past decades. Today you’ll find modern shopping centres and office buildings around the marketplace in front of the city hall. Chemnitz proudly presents itself as the “City of Modernity” with a number of impressive buildings. For example, the “Stadtbad” (municipal indoor pool), built in the famous Bauhaus style, is definitely worth seeing. You can combine exercise and sightseeing in one visit.",
        "section_21": "The Theaterplatz is where the popular „Film Nights“ take place during the summer. You can get together with friends and watch the latest movies on a big screen under the open sky. The Museum Gunzenhauser is a very famous Chemnitz museum which features the famous Expressionist painters. This and the König Albert Museum are definitely worth visiting.
