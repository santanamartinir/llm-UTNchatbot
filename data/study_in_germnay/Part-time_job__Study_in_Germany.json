Research assistants are employed at the university and must have completed at least six semesters of study. They support professors or other academic staff in their work in research and teaching.",
        "section_20": "HiWis can be responsible for supervising the library or researching literature for professors. Another job is as a tutor affiliated with a lecture or seminar where other students can deepen their knowledge under supervision, or prepare for exams.",

And those who work too much prolong their studies unnecessarily. Instead of taking a low-paying job, you can also apply for a  (/en/plan-your-studies/preparation/funding/) , for example.",
        "section_28": "Tax rules",
        "section_29": "You can earn up to 520 euros a month on a student job without paying taxes. But if you regularly earn more than 520 euros, you need a tax number. A certain amount is then deducted from your wages every month, which you get back when you file a German tax return at the end of the year.",
        "section_30": "Your contributions",
        "section_31": "Anyone permanently employed in Germany usually pays social security contributions.
