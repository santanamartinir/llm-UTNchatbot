This is a school-leaving certificate which qualifies you for university study. If your secondary-school certificate is deemed insufficient for study in Germany, you will have to attend a foundation course (“Studienkolleg”) before you are allowed to enrol.",

The  (https://www.daad.de/en/study-and-research-in-germany/plan-your-studies/admission-database/) can help you with this. Simply enter the country where you attained your secondary school-leaving certificate. You will then learn whether your certificate is",
        "section_20": "The DAAD entrance qualification database only provides a general overview. You can obtain more specific data about other countries and certificates at Anabin. This database includes information on how foreign secondary school-leaving certificates are evaluated. On the  (https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/schulabschluesse-mit-hochschulzugang.html#land_gewaehlt) website, you can specify your country and certificate when searching the database. It provides all relevant information, e. g. whether your certificate will be recognised and whether you will need to fulfil further requirements. The website, however, is only available in German.",
        "section_21": "Check the university’s website and uni-assist",
        "section_22": "The final decision on admission always rests with the higher education institution at which you are applying. For that reason, you should always inform yourself about the requirements for your chosen degree programme on the university’s website. Many German higher education institutions work together with  (https://www.uni-assist.de/en/) , a central point of contact for applicants with international educational certificates, which checks and evaluates foreign certificates. For this purpose, uni-assist issues international applicants with a preliminary review documentation (VPD), an official document that proves which higher education institution certificates were submitted and how the grades are to be classified in the German grading system.",
        "section_23": "A formal university entrance qualification is sometimes not required from talented candidates applying for admission to artistic subjects. Depending on the university, you may have to submit samples of your work or pass an aptitude test instead.",

        "section_25": "In addition to checking your higher education entrance qualification, you can have your higher education qualification that you did not obtain in Germany, e.g. in your home country, assessed. The Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB) offers the so-called  (https://zab.kmk.org/en/statement-comparability) for this purpose.  This official certificate classifies your university degree from abroad in the German education system. The certificate is issued exclusively in German and contains information such as the name of the university, the degree programme and the university degree.",
        "section_26": "It also contains general information about university admission. A “Statement of Comparability” may be necessary for admission to a German higher education institution. Please note, however, that a transcript evaluation does not automatically entitle you to admission.

        "section_28": "If you come from an EU country (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland) and your school-leaving certificate is recognised in that country, it is often recognised in Germany, as well. This also applies if you received an “Abitur” from one of more than 140 German Schools abroad. In that case you have the same status as someone who has been educated to upper secondary level in Germany and you are thereby on an equal footing with German citizens.",
