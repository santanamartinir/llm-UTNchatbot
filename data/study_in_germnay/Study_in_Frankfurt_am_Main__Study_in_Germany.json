The city’s international community gives the hectic metropolis a cosmopolitan flair. In fact, one out of three people on the street has a foreign passport. So no matter where you’re from, you won’t feel homesick in Frankfurt.",
        "section_19": "The best-known street in Frankfurt is the “Zeil”. This is where you can “shop till you drop”. On the rooftop of the “Zeilgalerie”, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Frankfurt. Right here in front of you is a perfect example of the contrast between modernity and tradition – on one side, the international banks in their skyscrapers and on the other, the Frankfurt Cathedral and St. Catherine’s Church.",
        "section_20": "There is another side of Frankfurt which offers inhabitants a high quality of life. A long green strip of land runs seven kilometres along the banks of the Main River. But the riverside is not the only place you can relax; there are over 8,000 hectares of greens and woods located throughout the city.",

The Römer has served as the city hall since the 16th century and, before that, it was used for coronations. St. Paul’s Church played an important role in bringing democracy to Germany. It was here in 1848 that the first freely elected national assembly convened. That’s why the church is called the “Cradle of German Democracy” and is one of the most important symbols of freedom and democracy in Germany today.",
        "section_22": "If you want to go out for a quiet evening, the Alt-Sachsenhausen district is ideal. There in the narrow streets you’ll find everything your heart desires – sport bars where you can watch football, Irish pubs and the typical Frankfurt hard-rock pubs.",
