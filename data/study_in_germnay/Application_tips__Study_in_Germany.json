        "section_21": "When you apply for a job at an SME, you should also take a careful look at how that company presents itself. Who founded it? Who is at the helm now? What values does it represent? The answers to those questions will help you have a convincing job interview.

        "section_28": "Leaving certificates",
        "section_29": "Part of your application should be your leaving certificates from school and university. If you have certificates from internships, include them as well. It’s important that you send copies and not originals. Many companies don’t return applications.",
        "section_30": "It may also be useful to have your leaving certificates from foreign university assessed, if you have any. This can also be mandatory for some employers.
