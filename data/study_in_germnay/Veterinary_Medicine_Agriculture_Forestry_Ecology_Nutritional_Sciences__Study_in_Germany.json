        "section_19": "Veterinary medicine is among the most popular courses of study in Germany. As in human medicine, it is not easy to be admitted to a university. You need a very good grade point average, because there is an admission restriction (called the numerus clausus, or NC) for the subject nationwide. Veterinarian programmes are limited because there are more applications than university places. Some of the admissions in NC subjects are allocated through the Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung  or Foundation for University Admissions, and some individual institutions.",
        "section_20": "If you decide to study out of love for animals, you should know that working in a veterinary clinic or a large animal practice can be physically demanding and strenuous. Weekend and night shifts are the rule. An internship can help you get a realistic picture of the profession. Many veterinarians are needed, especially in livestock husbandry. So you should be prepared to work in a rural community.",
        "section_21": "Working independently",
        "section_22": "The study of veterinary medicine in Germany takes almost six years. It begins with a theoretical phase of eight semesters at a university. In this phase you will begin to gain practical experience, including in the treatment of live animals. Practical experience is also compulsory in food inspection, in abattoirs, and in the public veterinary sector. After an internship in a practice or clinic, you finish your studies in veterinary medicine with the state examination.",
        "section_23": "Many graduates then open their own practice. Every other veterinarian in Germany is self-employed. Others work as employees in practices and veterinary clinics, in health control, in pharmaceutical companies, or in management and supervision of the livestock trade and meat production.",

        "section_27": "There are more than 60 degree programmes in nutrition science in Germany. The spectrum ranges from nutrition in developing countries, to the nutritional and physiological evaluation of food, to nutritional and counselling consumers. A distinction is made between nutritional sciences, trophology and ecotrophology, which is a branch of natural science nearly unique to Germany that deals with everyday household management, nutrition and economic practices.",
