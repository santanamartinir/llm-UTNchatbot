        "section_12": "Mannheim is love at second sight. The first thing you notice here are the industrial buildings with their cold grey walls. But then you are captivated by the charm and beauty of the town. \"Believe me, I'm staying here\", sings the band \"Söhne Mannheims\" in their song \"Meine Stadt\" (my town) – and rightfully so.",

        "section_18": "If you’re studying at the university, you might be lucky enough to have a lecture in the Baroque Palace, where you can admire the magnificent halls. This is a very special feeling. But you can also visit the palace at other times. You only have to pay admission if you want to visit the museum in the middle section.",
        "section_19": "Wandering through the city centre, you’ll soon notice how green Mannheim is. There are lots of parks, which attract crowds of people especially on sunny days. The locals often stroll along the shopping streets, known as the “Planken“, before they end the day at the Wasserturm.",
        "section_20": "Friedrichsplatz is right next to the Wasserturm. After an extensive tour of the town, you can cool off at the fountain. A few metres further along is the Luisenpark, rightly considered one of the most beautiful parks in Europe. An entrance fee is charged but you can admire lots of tropical plants, the Chinese Garden and animals.",
        "section_21": "If you fancy seeing Mannheim from above, it’s worth visiting the television tower. You will then have not only the city but the two Rhine and Neckar rivers at your feet. You also get a glimpse of the neighbouring towns of  (/en/plan-your-studies/study-options/cities/heidelberg/) and Ludwigshafen.",
        "section_22": "Once you’ve eaten your fill at a hip café and shopped till you dropped at the numerous shops and boutiques on “Planken“, explore the Jungbuschviertel. You can enjoy a cocktail in one of the many bars while listening to the bands of tomorrow.",
        "section_23": "But also bigger events like concerts, film screenings and cabaret evenings are on offer.",
